            influence within jazz. Many different genres and styles of jazz

            An amazing example of this that we’d like to shout out is an
            organization founded and focused on the idea of jazz as an evolving
            art form called Earshot Jazz. They are based in the Seattle area,
            active since 1984 and hold concert presentations and strive to
            cultivate a vivacious community of artists, educators, and
            audiences.
